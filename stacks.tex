\chapter{Stacks}
Our next data structure is the Stack.
The stack may seem unnecessary as a data structure after we introduce its features.  
After all, can't a list do all the things that a stack can do and more? 

Working with the limited operations of a allows us to approach problems with a different mindset.

\section{Stack Operations}

The stack operations are limited and simple. 


\begin{enumerate}
	\item[Push] Put an item on the top of the stack.
	\item[Pop]  Remove the item from the top of the stack and return it.  The item that was underneath the top of the stack becomes the new top.
	\item[Peek] Return the top of the stack, without removing it.
\end{enumerate}


That's it.  That's all there is.  It is refreshingly simple.
There will usually be additional functions, such as one to check if the stack is empty or a function to get the number of items stored in the stack, but \texttt{push}, \texttt{pop}, and \texttt{peek} are the important ones.




\section{Building a Stack}

We will be building a stack as a reference-based structure in this book.  This is so we can get a bit more practice with manipulating nodes.

\section{Built-in Stacks}


Python has no separate built-in stack. Rather, we instead use a  \href{https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#using-lists-as-stacks} {Rather, it uses the List that we are already familiar with} to emulate a stack\footnote{And the Queue, as we will see in Chapter \ref{chap-queue}} and operates on the last (right-most) index of the list.

If you want to use a Python list as a stack, merely restrict yourself to using the \texttt{append(item)} function in place of \texttt{push}.  Python lists have a \texttt{pop} method;  when called without any argument\footnote{When provided an index, \texttt{pop} removes and returns the item at that index.  Python uses \texttt{pop} to remove at an index, whereas \texttt{remove} is used to remove and return the first occurrence a specified item.},  it removes and returns the last element in the list.

Use \texttt{stackname[-1]} to \texttt{peek} at the top of the stack.

\section{Paren}

A classic stack problem is to write a program that checks to see if a given string has balanced parenthesis.
