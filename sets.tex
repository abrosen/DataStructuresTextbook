\chapter{Sets}
\label{chap-sets}
Sets programmed  implementations of mathematical sets




\section{Operations}

We will use Venn diagrams to graphically  demonstrate operates with two sets
\subsection{Adding an item to a Set}

Adding items to a set is fairly straightforward.




As we will see, adding to a set can be either $O(1)$ or $O(\log n)$ time, depending on the implementation

\subsection{Removing an item to a Set}


\subsection{Union}
In Java, this is the \texttt{addAll()} method.


\subsection{Intersection}


\subsection{Set Difference}

\subsection{Subset}

\section{Operation Analysis}

Most sets are implemented using a Hash Table.

\subsection{TreeSet Vs HashSet Vs Linked Hash Set}

\section{Sets and Problem Solving}

Sets are super efficient checklists.

\subsection{Checking for Uniqueness or Finding Duplicates}
