\chapter{Analyzing Algorithms}

\subsection{Cost}
Every function, operation, algorithm, or what have you that a computer performs has a \emph{cost}. In fact, there are always multiples costs;  we often just focus on the most important one or two costs.  
What is most important depends on context.

However, when we measure cost, we need to do abstractly.  
When we measure the amount of time that an algorithm takes

\subsubsection{Time}
A time cost is a measure of not just how long it takes a program to finish executing, bit also how the length of execution is affected by adding additional item.

Time is almost always \emph{the most important cost}.

\subsubsection{Space}
\subsubsection{Energy}
\subsubsection{Other costs - Bandwidth}

\section{Big O Notation}

\begin{itemize}
	\item What is big O
	
	\item  how to read it
	\item Aside about big omega and theta
	\item How wrong usage annoys mathematician
	\item refers to cost in general, but used for time usually
	\item  space complexity 
	\item Common runtimes
	\item runtimes we''ll focus on now
	\item runtimes we focus on later
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Space Complexity}

\section{Examples with Arrays}

\begin{itemize}
	
	\item Retrieval  - refer back to earlier chapter for address lookup 
	\item Replacement
	\item Linear Search
	\item Binary Search
\end{itemize}
