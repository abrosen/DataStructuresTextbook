\chapter{Analyzing Algorithms}
Or we would look at the list, but we need to talk about Math.  Sorry for the bait-and-switch, but it will make sense shortly.


You don't need  much math to be a good programmer, but if you want to be an amazing programmer, you probably need math or very math adjacent skills.
\section{Cost}
Every function, operation, algorithm, or what have you that a computer performs has a \emph{cost}. 
In fact, there are always multiples costs;  we often just focus on the most important one or two costs.  

What is most important depends on context.
However, in the vast majority of cases, the most important cost to focus on is \textbf{time}.
When our program is eating away at our storage resources like a hungry child slurping up spaghetti, we can always go out and buy more memory/storage/RAM.
If our program requires a large amount of energy consumption, energy is readily available from a variety of sources: batteries, power plugs, internal combustion engines, the giant fusion reactor in the sky.

Time is different.  We cannot got out and buy another weeks worth of time.  You can't hand a bunch of money to the reaper and ask for a deferral. You can't buy another minute to spend with your mother\footnote{Call your mother.  She would love to hear from you.} 
Yes, processors get faster as technology marches on, but they get faster slowly and Moore's law ostensibly has its limits.
The only way to make our programs realistically run faster is to make them more efficient.
 


\subsubsection*{Measuring Cost}
When we measure cost, we need to do abstractly.  
When we measure the amount of time that an algorithm takes, we look at the number of operations that will be executed, not the overall elapsed time.

\subsection{Time}
A time cost is a measure of not just how long it takes a program to finish executing, bit also how the length of execution is affected by adding additional item.

Time is almost always \emph{the most important cost}.

\section{Big O Notation}

\begin{itemize}
	\item What is big O
	
	\item  how to read it
	\item Aside about big omega and theta
	\item How wrong usage annoys mathematician
	\item refers to cost in general, but used for time usually
	\item  space complexity 
	\item Common runtimes
	\item runtimes we''ll focus on now
	\item runtimes we focus on later
\end{itemize}
