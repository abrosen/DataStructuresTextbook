\chapter{Functions and How They Work}

This will be an extremely short chapter, but an important one.
We are already going to assume that you know what a function, a method, or procedure is and that you have written them before.
After all, data structures is a point continuing your education in programming, not beginning it.
That said it is possible that you missed some subtleties along the way.

That's understandable -  programming is a very large topic and there's more than enough concepts to  



%\section{Function vs Method}

%You'll often hear programmers use these true terms interchangeably to refer to what essentially amounts to a subprogram.
%But what is the difference?  Methods are closely linked to objects;  they are the actions or verbs you want your objects to perform.



%\section{The Runtime Stack}

\section{Argument vs Parameter}
An argument is the actual value you pass in, the parameter is the variable that accepts it.


\begin{minted}{Java}
public static void doubleThis(int num) { 
	return 2*num;
}

public static void main(String[] args){
	int x = 7;
	int y = doubleThis(x);
}

\end{minted}

\begin{minted}{Python3}
	def doubleThis(num): 
		return 2*num
		
x =  7
y =  doubleThis(x)
\end{minted}

In the about examples, \texttt{x} is an argument and \texttt{num} is a parameter.


\subsection{Does anyone actually care?}

I cared enough to look it up, but I also had to look it up to double check that I'm correct and I keep coming back to this page as a reference for myself.  
In a casual situation or talking with another programmer, everyone will be able to \textit{grok} your meaning from the context, but I would take care to get it correct for your assignments and exams, much like you would take care to avoid using ``ain't'' in a formal essay.

\section{Passing Arguments}

The vast majority of programming languages are \textit{pass by copy} with a huge honking asterisk.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Pass by copy means that when something is input as the argument to a function, the function gets a copy of the thing you are passing to it.
	\item The \textit{huge honking asterisk} is that you are almost always passing a \textit{reference} or \textit{pointer} to an object, not the object itself.  The reason for this is that if we had a super mega huge object, copying it would take up a super mega huge amount of time and memory.
\end{itemize}



\subsection{How it Works in Java}
In Java, we have two broad categories of data types: primitives and objects.

When you pass a primitive, such as an \texttt{int} or \texttt{double}, the value gets copied from where it is stored in memory and copied into the argument.

When you create an object, as below:
\begin{minted}{Java}
Scanner scan =  new Scanner(System.in);
\end{minted}

The variable \texttt{scan} will hold not the Object that was created by the constructor, but the \textit{memory location} of where to find it.
Look at the code below where we are we create an array in \texttt{main} and then pass it to another method, \texttt{setIndexZeroToZero}:

\begin{minted}{Java}
public static void setIndexZeroToZero(int[] array) {
	array[0] = 0;
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
	int[] arr = {5,5,6,6};
	System.out.println(Arrays.toString(arr));
	// prints [5, 5, 6, 6]
	
	setIndexZeroToZero(arr);
	System.out.println(Arrays.toString(arr));
	// prints [0, 5, 6, 6]
}

\end{minted}

Because the memory location of the array \texttt{arr} was passed to \texttt{array}, the method \texttt{setIndexZeroToZero} was dealing with the same object. 


Keep in mind that some objects are immutable, like any \texttt{String}.  This means you can't actually change them.  Operations that seem like they change them like replacing part of a string or converting things from upper case to lower case are all returning a newly generated string.
\subsection{How it works in Python}

%fact check
Everything in Python is an object, so when things are passed or assigned into variables, the variable stores the memory location.
